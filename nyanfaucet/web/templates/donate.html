            First of all, thank you so much for considering to donate to this faucet! :3<br />
            This faucet is run as a free, non-profit service by members of the Ɲyancoin community.

            <h3>Donating keeps this faucet alive</h3>
            100% of all donated Ɲyancoins go directly into the faucet wallet. Yes, we run completely <strong>non-profit</strong> and there are no annoying banner ads.
